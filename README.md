## üõ°Ô∏è YARA Rule Support

YARA rules provide powerful pattern-based detection capabilities. Harkonnen includes a built-in YARA rule engine that can:

1. **Load custom rules** from a designated directory (default: `./rules/`)
2. **Apply rules** to scanned files for pattern matching
3. **Classify threats** based on rule metadata (severity, tags, etc.)
4. **Provide context** about detected patterns

### Creating Custom YARA Rules

YARA rules use a simple syntax to define patterns. Here's an example:

```
rule Suspicious_PowerShell {
    meta:
        description = "Detects obfuscated PowerShell scripts"
        severity = "medium"
        tags = "powershell,obfuscation"
    strings:
        $s1 = "FromBase64String" nocase
        $s2 = "Invoke-Expression" nocase
        $s3 = "IEX" nocase
        $s4 = "-enc" nocase
    condition:
        2 of them
}
```

Save custom rules as `.yar` files in the `rules/` directory, and they'll be automatically loaded when using the `-y` option.

## üìä Multi-threaded Scanning

Harkonnen v2.5.0 introduces parallel scanning capabilities to dramatically improve performance on multi-core systems:

1. **Automatic thread allocation** based on available CPU cores
2. **Workload distribution** across threads for optimal performance
3. **Thread-safe result collection** and reporting
4. **Progress tracking** during scanning

Enable parallel scanning with:
```bash
./harkonnen -p directory_to_scan
```

Or specify the exact number of threads:
```bash
./harkonnen -t 8 directory_to_scan
```

## üìã Reporting System

### HTML Reports

HTML reports provide rich visualizations and detailed information about scan results:

- **Threat summary** with statistics and charts
- **File details** for all scanned items
- **Detection information** including threat names, descriptions, and severity
- **System information** including hardware, OS, and scan configuration

Generate an HTML report:
```bash
./harkonnen -r html -O directory_to_scan
```

The `-O` flag automatically opens the report in your default browser.

### Text Reports

Text reports provide a concise summary in plain text format:

- **Scan overview**
- **Detection details**
- **System information**

Generate a text report:
```bash
./harkonnen -r text directory_to_scan
```

Or generate both formats:
```bash
./harkonnen -r both directory_to_scan
```

## üîÑ Signature Management

### Online Updates

Harkonnen can automatically update its signature database from Malware Bazaar:

```bash
./harkonnen -u
```

This fetches the latest malware signatures and adds them to the local database.

### Custom Signatures

You can import custom signatures from a file:

```bash
./harkonnen -i my_signatures.txt
```

The signature format is simple:
```
SHA256_HASH:Malware_Name
```
